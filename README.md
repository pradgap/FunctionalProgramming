Pattern Matching

Pattern matching is good to reverse construction process i.e. find out which class and its arguments are used. This is a very common necessity in functional programming which is accomplished using Case Classes. This can be thought of generalization of Switch in C/Java. Switch can be applied to numbers/ primitive types only but Pattern Matching can be applied to whole class hierarchies.
